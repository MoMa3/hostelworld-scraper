## About The Project

Scrapes Hostel world listings from 5 major cities in europe (more to come)

Here's why:
* Collect valuable data about hostel markets across the world
* Make better informed decisions on where to stay
* the date can be used for future listing to determine more accurate price 

## FUTURE IDEAS:
* search any city
* instead of exporting to CSV input into DB (maybe)
* search multiple cities 
* search by location (maybe)
* add trip parameters (check-in/out, number of guests, etc...)
* determine if price is good (maybe using ML)
